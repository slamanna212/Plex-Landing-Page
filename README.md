# Plex Landing Page
Landing Page for a Plex Server

Original code and assets are here: https://github.com/ITRav4/PlexRedirect 

Changes:

Bootstrap has been updated to newest available, 3.3.7

Un-needed assets removed

Code changed to just show Plex Status

Code redone for standards and readability reasons

**Quick Start**
Clone this code to a web server directory and add your plex servers hostname/IP address on line 33 of plex.js

You can change the text of the Help Modal by editing the text that starts on line 61 of index.php

In my enviorment this code is paired with https://github.com/causefx/iDashboard-PHP to integrate this, Plex Requests and Plex Email all on one page.
